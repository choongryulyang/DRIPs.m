    "## A Structure for LQG Dynamic Rational Inattention Problems (D.R.I.P.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "A LQG Dynamic Rational Inattention Problem (**drip**) is defined as the following tracking problem, where at any point in time the agent chooses a vector of actions $\\vec{a}_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ to track a Gaussian stochastic process $\\vec{x}_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    & \\min_{\\{\\vec{a}_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta^t (\\vec{a}_t - \\vec{x}_t'\\mathbf{H})'(\\vec{a}_t - \\vec{x}_t'\\mathbf{H}) - \\omega \\mathbb{I}(\\vec{a}^t;\\vec{x}^t|\\vec{a}^{t-1})\\lvert \\vec{a}^{-1}\\right] \\\\\n",
    "    s.t.\\quad &\n",
    "        \\vec{x}_t=\\mathbf{A}\\vec{x}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{Q}\\vec{u}_t,\\quad \\vec{u}_t\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\mathbf{I}^{k\\times k})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "* $\\vec{a}_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ is the vector of the agent's actions at time $t$ (a firms choosing a price, or a househld choosing consumption and labor etc.) We denote the number of actions by $m$.\n",
    "* $\\vec{x}_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the vector of the shocks that the agent faces at time $t$ that are exogenous to her decision, but could be endogenous to the GE model (marginal cost of a firm, real interest rates etc.) We denote the number of shocks by $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Parameters\n",
    "The LQG-DRI problem is characterized by the following parameters:\n",
    "* $\\omega\\in \\mathbb{R}_+$: cost of 1 bit of information in units of the agent's payoff. \n",
    "* $\\beta\\in[0,1]$: rate of discounting information.\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{A}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}, \\mathbf{Q}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}$: Determine the state space representation of $\\vec{x}_t$.\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{H}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$: interaction of payoffs with shocks. This comes from a second order approximation to the utility function and is such that under full information $\\vec{a}^*=\\mathbf{H}'\\vec{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Solution\n",
    "The solution to the dynamic rational inattention problem is a joint stochastic process between the actions and the states: $\\{(\\vec{a}_t,\\vec{x}_t):t\\geq 0\\}$. Moreover, in some economic applications, we are also interested in the law of motion for the agent's belief about $\\vec{x}_t$ under the optimal information structure $\\hat{x}_t=\\mathbb{E}_t[\\vec{x}_t]$ where the expectation is taken conditional on the agent's time $t$ information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorem 2 and Proposition 3 in [Afrouzi and Yang (2019)](http://www.afrouzi.com/dynamic_inattention.pdf) characterize this joint distribution as a function of a tuple $(\\mathbf{K},\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_z)$ where\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\vec{a}_t &= \\mathbf{H}'\\hat{x}_t = \\mathbf{H}'\\mathbf{A}\\hat{x}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{Y}'(\\vec{x}_t-\\mathbf{A}\\hat{x}_{t-1})+\\vec{z}_t \\\\\n",
    "    \\hat{x}_t &= \\mathbf{A}\\hat{x}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{Y}'(\\vec{x}_t-\\mathbf{A}\\hat{x}_{t-1})+\\mathbf{K}\\vec{z}_t,\\quad \\vec{z}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\Sigma_z)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{K}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$ is the Kalman-gain matrix of the agent in under optimal information acquisition in the stationary solution.\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{Y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m}$ maps the state to the agent's action under rational inattetion and govern the covariance of the two.\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_z\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m}$ is the variance-covariance matrix of the agent's rational inattention error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these, we might also be interested in the agent's prior and posterior subjective undertainty, along with the continution value that she assigns to information:\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{p}=\\mathbb{V}ar(\\vec{x}_t|\\vec{a}^{t})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$.\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{-1}=\\mathbb{V}ar(\\vec{x}_t|\\vec{a}^{t-1})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$, \n",
    "* $\\bar{\\Omega}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix $\\bar{\\Omega}$, which is the continuation value of information, is also important for the number of iterations that the code needs to converge. When $n$ is large, accurate guesses for $\\bar{\\Omega}$ and $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{-1}$ speed up the convergence considerably.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solver for the Steady State of D.R.I.P.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver function is `solve_drip(ω,β,A,Q,H;Σ0 = A*A'+Q*Q',Ω0 = H*H')`. It takes the primitives `(ω,β,A,Q,H;Σ0,Ω0)` as arguments, where the arguments `Σ0,Ω0` are the initial guesses for $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{-1}$ and $\\bar{{\\Omega}}$ and are optional for cases in which an accurate initial guess is at hand. If not specified, the default values are set as `Ω0=H*H'` and `Σ0=Q*Q'`. See the code for extra options regarding tolerance of convergence, maximum number of iterations, and updating weight for every iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns the solution of the model within a `drip` structure,  that contains all the primitives and the solution objects of the model:"
